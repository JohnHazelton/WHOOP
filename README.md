# Data Viz - Activities & Recoveries (WHOOP, Strava)
Data Science project using activity, sleep, and recovery data from Strava &amp; WHOOP apps. 
Here, I analized my personal fitness band data (Garmin to Strava for runs, workouts; WHOOP for recoveries, sleep) to determine the features that
were most impactful on achieving ample recovery. I also created visualizations for the results of my analysis, as well as live trackers showing
aggregate data on all of my workouts and stats, year-to-date. These can be seen at: ___________________.
